Horiseon Social Solution Services - Accessibility Standards 
For this project, we aim to improve their database by consolidating their code to be more concise and focused.  My main motivation for this project is to find a better way to rewrite the codes so that other programmers in different departments can easily read our codebase. We built this project to equip start-up companies with vital information that will enable their success. We found that more than 68% of start-ups do not succeed in their first-year.  We believe this website would be of great benefit to those who are looking to start their own companies; those who did not achieve their goals in their first-year; and those who are on the verge of closing.  Through research, we found that the companies that succeeded in their first-year had several advantages: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. We also learned that companies that were unable to capitalize on such resources did not meet their achievement. We are confident that a start-up company that takes advantage of these tools are more likely to succeed. We have also outlined some other areas that companies should be well versed in such as Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. Our research also indicated that a high percentage of companies that did not succeed were not aware of these additional topics and how to maximize their profits by taking advantage of them. We want to create a platform that provides equitable resources to entrepreneurs despite any limitations.  Horiseon Social Solution Services marketing agency is focusing on creating a codebase that meets certain accessibility standards so their website is optimized for search engines.  Being able to accomplish this for Horiseon Social Solution Services will increase their online traffic and widen their consumer marketing by reaching to those who face accessibility challenges.
